# SBU_multiplayer-snake-game
<My first project in c++, for "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" class.>

download the zip file and then run main.cpp to start the game.

description : One to three people can play this snake game. 
Every player who enters his information is registered in the game 
and can play again with others whenever he wants.
The score of all players is saved and can be seen on the leaderboard.
snakes must eat fruits and avoid bombs and walls.

ENJOY PLAYING WITH FRIENDS ^_~

Ofcourse there are many issues in my code, so
I appreciate any feedback :)
